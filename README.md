# uhppoted-lib-go

** IN DEVELOPMENT **

Standalone Go library for the UHPPOTE access controllers.

_uhppoted-lib-go_ supersedes [_uhppote-core_](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-core) for external use:

- _uhppote-core_ was developed a **long** time ago, long before generics and other modern constructs were available in Go and is 
starting to show its age
- the _uhppoted-lib-go_ API conforms to the informal conventions of the other _uhppoted-lib-xxx_ projects
- the _uhppoted-lib-go_ implementation is considerably simpler and easier to understand and maintain

A basic example CLI illustrating the use of the library can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-lib-go/tree/main/examples)
folder.
